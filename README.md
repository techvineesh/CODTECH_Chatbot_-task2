## Colorful Chatbot

This project is a simple graphical chatbot application implemented in Java using Swing components. The Colorful Chatbot engages users in conversation by responding to input and providing predefined messages based on the conversation count.

### Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Users can interact with the chatbot through a graphical user interface (GUI) featuring a chat area and an input field.
- **Conversation Handling**: The chatbot responds differently based on the number of interactions (conversation count) with the user.
- **Customizable Interface**: Users can customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior by modifying the source code.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for running and editing Java code.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming and event-driven GUI development.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/colorful-chatbot.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the `ColorfulChatbot.java` file to launch the Colorful Chatbot application.

### Usage

- **Chatting with the Chatbot**:
  1. Launch the Colorful Chatbot application.
  2. Enter your name when prompted by the chatbot.
  3. Engage in conversation by responding to the chatbot's prompts and questions.
  4. The chatbot will respond with predefined messages based on the conversation count.

### Structure

- **`ColorfulChatbot.java`**: Main class implementing the chatbot functionality using Java Swing components.
- **`sendMessage(String message)`**: Method to append messages to the chat area.
- **`actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)`**: Event handler for user input actions.

### Additional Notes

- **Icons and Images**: The chatbot icon (`chatbot_icon.png`) displayed at the top of the GUI can be replaced with your custom image.
- **Customization**: Feel free to modify the chatbot's responses, appearance, or conversation logic by editing the source code.
